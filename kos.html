                <h1>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>There are 18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of the country. Among them, Kosgoda turtle
                    hatchery, started in 1981, is one of the oldest turtle conservation projects in Sri Lanka. Kodgoda
                    turtle hatchery is quite popular for having all five turtle species seen on the country's beaches.
                    Functioning as a hatchery, Kosgoda projects envisage much more to preserve the turtle life on the
                    shore. They run various activities and volunteer programs for locals and international tourists to
                    go through and have a knowledge of processes of turtle hatching.</p>
                <h1>Turtle Species Protected at Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>
                <p>
                    There are only 7 turtle species identified in the world itself (six of them classified as endangered
                    because of human actions) and Sri Lankan has recorded 5 species nestling on its pristine beaches.
                    Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery houses 4 of all five turtle species in Sri Lanka including "white turtle",
                    the very rare species.
                </p>
                <br>

                        feet in length.</li>
                    <li>Loggerhead Turtle - One of the larger species of sea turtles that weighs 90 - 180 kg and sies up

                <h1>Activities & Hatching Process Undertaken by Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>
                <p>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery keeps a determined goal to protect sea turtle eggs by increasing hatching
                    rates. In addition to mere hatching, they care for wounded, disabled, and weak turtles from fishing.
                    At nights, the volunteers walk down the shore looking for turtles that are about to lay eggs. Once
                    the mother turtles are over with laying eggs, the volunteers take the eggs to the hatchery from the
                    beach. The eggs might take 45 to 60 days to develop and hatch. Once hatched, the baby turtles are
                    returned to the ocean quite quickly, normally in the late evenings in order to reduce the preying of
                    birds and crabs.</p>
                <h1>Where Located & How to Reach Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>
                <p>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is located in a coastal village located on the South Western stretch of Sri
                    Lanka with a relaxing atmosphere for beach holidaymakers as well. The village is located around 70
                    Kilometers away from Colombo city. Getting here is quite easy by road. Whether you are opting bus or
                    driving your vehicle, Colombo -Galle A2 highway or E01 Southern Express highways are your options,
                    both taking you less than two hours to reach the turtle hatchery.</p>
                <h1>Being a Volunteer at Kosgoda Hatchery</h1>
                <p>
                    Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery provides an interesting activity for any locals or tourists who have a flair
                    for loving nature and learning about turtle habitats. You can have both short-term and long-term
                    projects of your own ideas here. If you let them know prior to your arrival, they can facilitate the
                    best options and ideas for you. Most commonly, guests simply become a part of its daily activities
                    like searching for eggs, taking them to the hatchery, caring for the wounded, feeding them, and
                    protecting the habitats. At a price, it can provide you accommodation and foods in addition to
                    several recreational programs like water sports and excursions. Better you do some research about
                    the mission on the internet beforehand if you are intending to be a part of the Kosgoda project in
                    order to have easy ways around the turtle things.
